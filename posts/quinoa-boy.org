David Lynch passed away last year. He made a [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSP-ewdJYJc][video]] going over a quinoa recipe, and in his honor I decided to explore cooking with this grain that I hadn't used a lot before.

Before bland and meh

pearl-y consistency like caviar o pearl couscous

nuttiness


And we stir and around and around and around it goes, and it's ready to serve.
